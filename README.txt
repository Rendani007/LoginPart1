- This project is a simple demonstration of validation.
- I created a form validator for a simple login page using HTML, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
- Basically, I'm using JS to create classes that will validate the login variables based on certain rules 
then I stored the information in the browser for authentication (Sessions).
